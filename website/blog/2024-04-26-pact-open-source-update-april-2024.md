### Solving the integration testing puzzle with contract-based testing


Bas Dijkstra is an independent test automation consultant and trainer, who has been active in the test automation field for some 16 years now, and has worked on software testing and automation solutions across a wide range of programming languages, frameworks and technology stacks.

![Bas](https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/C4E03AQEVgM60TCWeJQ/profile-displayphoto-shrink_200_200/0/1635001164013?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=9dMTpnJRzzeRxGrXKWk4Svcdp5tL-3ayYSWb9t0-R9I)

He recently delivery a talk about contract testing with Pact.NET, which you can watch [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbVTuyWui-0).

I'll hand over to Bas in his own words, to describe what's in store.

>Setting up and running integration and end-to-end tests in distributed software systems is hard. Making sure that all components are deployed, with the right version, in the right state, with the right data is a challenging task for many teams.

>Contract-based testing is an approach that tries to address this problem and simplify and speed up integration testing for distributed software systems.

>In this talk and recorded demo, you'll learn about the basic principles behind contract-based testing, the questions it tries to answer, and the three different approaches to contract-based testing. You will also see contract-based testing in action, using the well-known Pact.Net library for C#. To wrap up the talk, we will also talk about how to adopt contract-based testing in your team and organization, and some of the potential pitfalls that should be addressed along the way.

## Hot new reads

We've often wondered when a book dedicated to contract testing would appear on the scene. We even had this statement on the [books section](https://docs.pact.io/books) of our site

> We're not aware of any books currently dedicated to contract testing, but here are some that talk about Pact and contract testing as part of a broader microservices development and testing strategy

However good news everybody ðŸŽº

### Contract Testing In Action

[![Contract Testing In Action book cover](/img/books/cover_contract_testing_in_action_small.png)](https://mng.bz/gv8l)

We are pleased to announce that Contract testing experts Marie Cruz and Lewis Prescott, have put pen to paper, and have just released the Contract Testing in Action ðŸ“• under the MEAP (Manning Early Access Program).

> Contract Testing in Action is a hands-on guide to contract testing for microservices applications and other systems of loosely-coupled components. After learning the basics of contract design and implementation, youâ€™ll dive into constructing your own contract testing framework. Youâ€™ll explore the leading contract testing tools, including Pact, PactFlow, and GitHub Actions. Plus, youâ€™ll set up consumer-driven contract testing for REST and GraphQL APIs and learn to integrate contract testing into a CI/CD pipeline. Finally, youâ€™ll delve into provider-driven contract testing, which simplifies adoption by utilizing your existing stack and practices.

What does early access mean for you?

1. You get a book dedicated to Contract Testing, written by industry leading experts.
2. You get the chance to offer direct feedback, into the chapters as they progress. You can join the discussion forum [here](https://livebook.manning.com/forum?product=cruz2).
   1. This allows you to stamp your mark on the world of contract testing.
3. If you love the book, we would love the following:
   1. Quotes that could be used in the book
   2. Social Media promotion
