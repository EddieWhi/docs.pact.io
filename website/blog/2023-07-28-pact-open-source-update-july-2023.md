:wave: Hello, its July, it's scorching so I hope you've got an ice cream to accompany you this episode or maybe a brolly if you are stuck in a rain-shower!

For the keener of our readers, you may note we missed our June episode. I was on holiday ( a rare treat! ) which was spent mainly away from the keyboard,
with the exception of a little flurry in pact-python.

Never fear, a double-dose of Pact Open Source updates are here!

### Pact-Net

The PactNet 5.0 RFC is complete with PactNet [5.0.0.beta.1](https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-net/releases/tag/5.0.0-beta.1) now released.

This bring in the ability to generate V4 Specification Pact's using the same API as V3 sync and async pacts and utilise combined pact files for both http and message based interactions. This removes the limitation requiring services which comprise of both http and message-based interactions to be named differently.

See the [migration guide for upgrading to PactNet 5.x](https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-net/blob/master/docs/upgrading-to-5.md)

### Pact-Go

Pact-Go V2 has officially been released, following an extended beta period. We are very grateful to our many early users who provided invaluable feedback.

You can check out the full release notes [here](https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-go/releases/tag/v2.0.0)

and for those migrating from v1, you can check out the migration guide [here](https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-go/blob/master/MIGRATION.md)

This update replaces the pact-ruby core, with the pact-rust core, utilized through the pact_ffi library, bringing support for V3 and V4 Pact specifications and the ability to load pact-plugins to extend the capabilities of pact-go.

- Supported platforms.
  - Linux x86_64 / arm64
  - MacOS x86_64 / arm64
  - Windows x86_64

Please note that Alpine Linux is not supported at this time.

#### New Features

- [support binary bodies in async plugin messages #302](https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-go/pull/302) fixes [ContentType being set as application/json for protobuf messages #265](https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-go/issues/265)

### Pact-JS

JavaScripters/TypeScripters/Nodemads

We listened to our community, who struggled with requiring python to install pact-js in order to get at that lovely rust pact-core functionality in pact-js v10 & v11 and pact-js-core v13

You can now find they both come fully charged with batteries included, meaning that supported platforms can use pact js v12 and pact-js-core v14 with `--ignore-scripts true` and no additional install time build requirements

- Supported platforms.
  - Linux x86_64 / arm64
  - MacOS x86_64 / arm64
  - Windows x86_64
- [Migration notes](https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-js/blob/master/MIGRATION.md#11xx---12xx)
- Troubleshooting
  - [Failed to find native build](https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-js/blob/master/docs/troubleshooting.md#failed-to-find-native-build)
  - [Failed to find node:path](https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-js/blob/master/docs/troubleshooting.md#enoent-no-such-file-or-directory-open-nodepath)
  
In addition, the new releases now support versions of Node 16 and greater, CI testing has been dropped for earlier versions, and we explicitly set the `engines` value in the `package.json` of both `pact-js` and `pact-js-core` to honour this restriction. We would advise updating your projects to an in support LTS version, (Node 18 LTS is probably most sensible at this point and node 16 is due to EOL on 11th Sept 2023)

- [Pact-JS v12 Release Notes](https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-js/releases/tag/v12.0.0)
- [Pact-JS-Core v14 Release Notes](https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-js-core/releases/tag/v14.0.0)

#### New Features

#### Pact-graph-network

We [mentioned](https://docs.pact.io/blog/2022/11/17/pact-2022-end-of-year-wrapup#dec) Guillaume Camus's pact-graph-network tool back in December. It's just [been updated](https://github.com/ManoManoTech/pact-graph-network/releases/tag/v0.8.0) to support multiple target architectures, and [now supports authentication mechanisms](https://github.com/ManoManoTech/pact-graph-network#usage) whether you have a basic auth protected Pact Broker, or a Bearer token protected PactFlow Broker.

So what are waiting for? Go forth and generate some broker charts, and why not share us your graphs via https://twitter.com/@pact_up or pact-slack.

## Hello Jo

I imagine you've heard of [Cucumber](https://cucumber.io/), the testing tool, not the veggie, If not, Cucumber is a tool for running automated acceptance tests guided by a technique called BDD (Behaviour-Driven Development), written in plain language called Gherkin. It has strong overlaps with our principles of contract testing and the Pact DSL, and is often part of a development teams tool-set alongside Pact for developing robust, quality systems. The similarities don't end there, it also has a thriving community which has been spearheaded by Jo Laing, in [GitHub](https://github.com/cucumber), [Slack](https://cucumber.io/docs/community/get-in-touch/) and in [many events](https://cucumber.io/resources/) across the globe.

I have the pleasure of inviting her to join me in my role as community shepherd, and know she will be helping to bring some organisation to the fold, including things like maintainer sessions and training, she has worked on the [Cucumber school](https://cucumber.io/school/) which is an incredible free resource to help those learn about BDD, I would :heart: a Pact School - if such a thing would float users boats.

## Pactober

__Celebrating Pact's 10 Year Milestone__

2023 marks 10 years of Pact Open Source. To celebrate, during the month of October â€“ which weâ€™ve coined Pactober â€“ weâ€™re facilitating community events across the globe to celebrate and acknowledge the journey and look forward to the future of Pact.

Be sure to bookmark our [Pactober event page](https://pact.io/pactober.html) where you can register to keep up to date, or to join us in hosting an event. We want to bring you all in to the celebrations, and help bring more contributors to the Pact family and help it live for another
10 years and beyond

## Thats a wrap

Thatâ€™s it for this month. Stay safe and carry on coding!
