[Pact Go](https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-go/) currently supports all versions of the Pact specification including support for HTTP, synchronous messages, plugins and more. Checkout the [README](/implementation_guides/go/readme) to get started.

## Pact Go Workshop

If you'd like to go a little deeper, we have a [workshop](https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-workshop-go) that will take 1-2 hours. It goes into all of the key topics, and will take you from a novice to intermediate level understanding.

## Examples
